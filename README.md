Speech Recognition Virtual Mouse

A *Speech Recognition Virtual Mouse* that allows you to control your computer’s mouse and perform actions using *voice commands*.  
Built with *Python, this project uses **speech recognition* to perform operations such as moving the cursor, clicking, scrolling, opening applications, and more — without touching a physical mouse.
